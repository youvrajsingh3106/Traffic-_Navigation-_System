# Traffic-_Navigation-_System
This project aims to develop a Traffic Navigation and Signal Management System that simulates real-time vehicle movement, optimizes traffic signal timing, and provides shortest route suggestions for drivers. The solution will also prioritize emergency vehicles, reducing their waiting time and enabling faster response during critical situations.
